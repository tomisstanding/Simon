# Project #1: Simon

This game consists of html, css, and jQuery

To get started I first decided to style my page and create my elements on the page, mostly because
I knew I was going to be staring at the screen for along time and didn't want it to be an eyesore right off the bat.

### Approach taken

I decided to style the page with a simple transparent header and a black
background for the gameboard area, and chose to go with a green body background 
to add a little bit of style. I remembered I had a pretty awesome video 
game style font that I used in my prework that I grabbed and used for all
the fonts used in the game including the start button, header, and round numbers.

I wanted to add additional features like a hard mode with random gifs and changing
background colors, and maybe other things but ultimately ran out of time but plan on 
working additionally on this one. I had a lot of fun coding this game and was 
a great challenge for myself.

### User Stories

The user is presented with a total of four different colored buttons in which they will flash in sequential order which the user must match each round.

The user will start the game by first clicking the start button to initiate the sequence of flashing colors which the user will then repeat to move on to the next round.

The user will watch the first sequence and click the exact sequence which will lead to the next round/sequence. 

The user does not officially ever "win" the game, and if the sequence is not matched correctly the user will be displayed with a "game over" notification.

The user can restart the game then by clicking the start button again and repeating these steps.

### Arising Issues...

I ran into quite a few issues during the creation of this game. The number one thorn in my foot was trying to format how I was going to manipulate certain elements in the DOM, make the buttons functional, and keeping the score of the game. I read a few MDN articles on DOM manipulation a few W3 school pages and got a lot of help from my class mates and teachers.
